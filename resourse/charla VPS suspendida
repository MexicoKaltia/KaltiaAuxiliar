You need to add this domain first your VPS control panel: https://31.220.60.92:10000/
Create a Virtual Host in VirtualMin admin panel
14:30
Then when the Virtual Host is created for this domain, go a head to your Domain management page in hostinger and set ChildNameservers to point to your VPS IP: https://prnt.sc/hjk6kt
And the last step, in the domain management page, change the nameservers to be your Childnameservers.

In linux VPS, you need to install mail services and SSL.
You can check this guide how to install mail: https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_14.04&p=httpd&f=18

about :  "VPS is not active and can't be managed."
12:53
why is the reason ?
13:22
Hello.
13:22
hi Mantas
the VPS is kaltia.mx
13:25
Yes, I can see that the VPS was suspended due to abuse report.
This is what I can see from the report:
Hacked and infected with a virus / trojan ( SPAM, DOS attacks are comming from the server )  
[root@vps ~]# lsof -p 11312 COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME Lixsyn 11312 root cwd DIR 182,619969 4096 791978 /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.24/bin Lixsyn 11312 root rtd DIR 182,619969 4096 2 / Lixsyn 11312 root txt REG 182,619969 1223123 789485 /tmp/Lixsyn Lixsyn 11312 root 0u CHR 1,3 0t0 1617182332 /dev/null Lixsyn 11312 root 1u CHR 1,3 0t0 1617182332 /dev/null Lixsyn 11312 root 2u CHR 1,3 0t0 1617182332 /dev/null Lixsyn 11312 root 3uW REG 182,619969 5 789618 /tmp/gates.lod Lixsyn 11312 root 4u IPv4 2025936974 0t0 TCP kaltia.mx:38172->103.193.128.199:9966 (ES TABLISHED) Lixsyn 11312 root 6u raw 0t0 2015489711 00000000:0011->00000000:0000 st=07
13:26
why abuse ? , i mean, the apache tomcat is mode off, and any resourse isnÂ´t active
13:27
how can i control about this issue ?. Do you have a script to fix this issue
13:28
You'd need to reinstall the VPS template in this case and use some precautions to prevent getting hacked in the future.
I can unsuspend it for you now.
But please, re-install the OS.
13:29
okas,  but i need reconfigurate all my members (tomcat server and Mey sql server and  ssl  cryptos server )
13:30
Yes, you will need to reconfigure them.
13:30
its only solution for this issue ?
13:30
You can try locating and removing the virus from your existing template if you know how to do that.
13:31
but i incist, the tomcat app server is mode off, i cant understand why report abuse from /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.24/bin
13:32
It appears that your VPS was hacked and it has a virus on it.
13:32
:(
how can protected my VPS for any risk ?
13:33
buy a SSL , maybe ?
13:33
You can use additional packages which secures the server, for example:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW
https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
13:34
ok, i check out it
so to resolve this issue i need reinstal my SO...
13:35
 i'll follow your instructions
13:35
The simplest way would be starting from scratch.
13:36
i agree
13:37
i have my restore, isn't problem
13:38
so, this moment can i acces for my VPS ?  for reinstall SO
13:39
You can access it now. :)
13:39
ok iwas able acces
13:40
Finally, how can I avoid hacking, with the links that you sent me, is that enough?
13:41
That should be enough, but if you want to take on more precautions - this article should help: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-securing-your-linux-vps
